# 🔐 Image Encryption Pro

Image Encryption Pro is a modern, secure, GUI-based Python application that uses AES encryption to protect image files from unauthorized access or tampering. Built with CustomTkinter, it features a clean UI, real-time image preview, and strong encryption key handling for maximum usability and security.

📄 Internship Project:  Pinnacle Labs Cybersecurity Internship  – Task: "Image Encryption Tool"

# ✨ Features

🔐 AES Encryption for secure visual data protection

🧬 Live Image Preview before encryption or after decryption

🔑 Key Generation for creating secure, random encryption keys

🌄 CustomTkinter GUI for a sleek, professional look

💾 Save Anywhere: Choose custom file save paths

⛔ Fully Offline – No internet needed, 100% local security

# 🔧 Technologies Used

Technology

Purpose

Python 3.8+

Core programming language

Pillow (PIL)

Image processing

CustomTkinter

Modern GUI framework

Cryptography

AES encryption (Fernet)

Tkinter Dialogs

File selection and save dialogs

# ▶️ How It Works

Select an image file (.png, .jpg, .jpeg)

Generate or paste an AES encryption key

Click Encrypt to save a secure .enc file

Click Decrypt and select an .enc file to restore the original image

⚠️ You must use the same key for both encryption and decryption.

# 📄 Installation

pip install customtkinter pillow cryptography
