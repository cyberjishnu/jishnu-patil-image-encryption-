# üîê Internship Report ‚Äì Image Encryption Tool


Intern Name: Jishnu Dipak Patil

Internship Title: Cybersecurity Internship Program 2025

Project Task: Task No. 4 ‚Äì Image Encryption

#### Organization: Pinnacle Labs

Project Duration: June 2025 ‚Äì July 2025

# ‚úèÔ∏è Objective

To design and develop a tool that encrypts and decrypts image files, protecting visual data from unauthorized access or tampering. The goal is to ensure confidentiality of image-based content through secure cryptographic techniques.

# üîç Project Description

Image Encryption Pro is a Python-based GUI application that implements AES encryption to protect image files from unauthorized access. The tool is developed using CustomTkinter for a modern interface, and utilizes the cryptography library's Fernet module to perform robust encryption and decryption operations.

Users can securely encrypt any image (PNG, JPG, JPEG) into an unreadable .enc file and decrypt it back to the original image using the same key. The interface includes features like live image preview, automatic key generation, and secure save functionality.

# ‚ú® Key Features

AES encryption for secure image protection

Real-time image preview for visual feedback

Random secure key generation with copy protection

Sleek and modern GUI using CustomTkinter

Offline tool ‚Äì works without internet

Supports multiple image formats (.png, .jpg, .jpeg)

# üîß Technologies Used

Technology

Purpose

Python 3.8+

Programming language

Pillow (PIL)

Image processing

CustomTkinter

Building a modern and responsive GUI

Cryptography

AES encryption using Fernet module

Tkinter Dialogs

File selection and save operations

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works

The user selects an image file from their system.

A secure encryption key is either generated or pasted.

Clicking Encrypt saves the image as a secure .enc file.

Clicking Decrypt loads a .enc file and restores the image using the same key.

The output is saved in a format identical to the original (e.g., .png).

Note: The same encryption key is required for both encryption and decryption.

# üìÖ Sample Use Case

Input Image: confidential_photo.png

Encrypt using key: b'Cy1Tx...==

Output File: encrypted_confidential.enc

Decrypt with same key: b'Cy1Tx...==

Output Image: restored_confidential.png

# üíº Learning Outcomes

Gained practical understanding of AES encryption principles.

Applied Python libraries for real-world file security applications.

Built a user-friendly tool that demonstrates both functionality and security.

Improved GUI design skills and file handling mechanisms.

# üìÑ Conclusion

This project offered a valuable opportunity to explore real-world cybersecurity applications, particularly in visual data protection. By building a GUI-based encryption tool from scratch, I strengthened my knowledge in cryptography, GUI development, and secure data handling. The final result is a simple yet powerful tool for anyone who wants to protect images against unauthorized access.
